Experiment 9 — Build, Dockerize, and CI (short)

What this demonstrates:
- Build the app (npm run build) to generate dist/.
- Create a Docker image and run the container (check logs/status in Docker Desktop).
- Tag and push the image to Docker Hub.
- Verify an automated build with GitHub Actions.

This folder contains screenshots proving each step. The app’s source lives in react-projects/Experiment-9/; this folder is the evidence of build → container → push → CI.
