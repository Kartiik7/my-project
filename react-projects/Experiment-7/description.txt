In this experiment we try React basic. First we make ProductCard component, it take props for product name, price, inStock and show inside box. 
We keep many product in array and use map() to show many card without writing again and again. After that we also make theme change button. 
With state in React we switch between light and dark background, and CSS variable change color. 
So this experiment show how to pass props, how to render many items, and how to use state for theme switch.
