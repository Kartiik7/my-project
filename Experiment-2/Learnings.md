# Learnings

Main thing I learned was how flexbox works for centering stuff properly. Before this I didn't know about justify-content and align-items properties.

Media queries were totally new for me. Now I understand how to make different CSS rules for different screen sizes which is pretty cool.

Also learned that removing default button styles and adding custom ones makes UI look much better. Box-sizing border-box property is really helpful for sizing calculations.
