Capstone Project — Full‑stack Web Application

This Capstone Project is a full-stack web application built with a Node.js/Express backend and a Vite-based frontend. It demonstrates user authentication, role-based admin routes, a RESTful API, integration with Firebase Admin, and containerization support via Docker.

Key features:
- User registration and login (JWT-based authentication)
- Admin routes for managing application data
- REST API endpoints for front-end consumption
- Firebase Admin integration for server-side operations
- Jest-based backend tests
- Docker and docker-compose for containerized development

Location of code:
- Backend: `Capstone_Project/backend/` (entry: `server.js` or `app.js`, routes in `routes/`, controllers in `controllers/`)
- Frontend: `Capstone_Project/frontend/` (Vite project, source in `src/`)

Quick start (developer):
1. Backend: install dependencies and run from `Capstone_Project/backend/` (create a `.env` with DB and auth secrets). 
2. Frontend: install dependencies and run from `Capstone_Project/frontend/`.

Notes:
- Ensure Firebase credentials (if used) are available at `backend/serviceAccountKey.json` or supplied via environment variables. Do not commit secrets.
- Update `README.md` with exact environment variable names, API endpoints, and any project-specific setup before distribution.
