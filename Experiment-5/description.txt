In this experiment, we created a simple web page that displays a list of products and allows users to filter them by category.
Both products and categories are stored in JavaScript arrays. The dropdown menu is filled dynamically from the category array, and when the user selects a category, 
JavaScript updates the product list on the page without reloading. Additionally, the main container has been centered in the body to improve the overall appearance and give the page a neat, balanced layout. 
This experiment helps in understanding how arrays, event handling, and DOM manipulation can be combined to make web pages interactive and user-friendly.
