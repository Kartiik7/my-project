Experiment 17A - Redux Toolkit Shopping Cart

OBJECTIVE:
Demonstrate Redux Toolkit for state management in a React application through a simple shopping cart implementation.

WHAT'S IMPLEMENTED:
- Redux Toolkit store configuration with cart state management
- Shopping cart functionality: add products, update quantities, remove items
- Three main components: ProductList, ShoppingCart, and Header
- Real-time state updates across all components
- Cart slice with modern Redux syntax using createSlice

KEY FEATURES:
- Add products to cart with "Add to Cart" buttons
- Update item quantities directly in the cart
- Remove items from cart
- Display total items count and total amount in header
- Persistent state management across component interactions

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
- React with Vite
- Redux Toolkit (createSlice, configureStore)
- React-Redux hooks (useSelector, useDispatch)

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
- Understanding Redux Toolkit's simplified approach to state management
- Implementing actions and reducers with createSlice
- Managing complex application state across multiple components
- Real-time UI updates based on state changes

FILES STRUCTURE:
- store/store.js: Redux store configuration
- store/cartSlice.js: Cart-specific state and actions
- components/: ProductList, ShoppingCart, Header components
- App.jsx: Main application component
