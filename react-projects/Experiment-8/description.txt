Experiment-8: Library Management UI

This experiment implements a simple React-based library management interface. 
Users can view a list of books, search by title or author, add new books, and remove existing ones. 
All actions update the UI instantly without page reloads. The app starts with three sample books and uses functional components with
React hooks for state management. Styling is handled via CSS for a clean and modern look.
